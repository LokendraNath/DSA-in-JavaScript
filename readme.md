# 📘 JavaScript DSA Notes

Welcome to my **JavaScript + DSA Learning Repository** 🚀

## 📖 About This Repo

This repository contains all my **notes, practice code, and learnings** while I am studying **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with JavaScript**.  
I am following video lectures and online resources, and here I write down my **personal notes, explanations, and code snippets** to strengthen my concepts.

## ✨ What You’ll Find Here

- 📂 Topic-wise notes (Arrays, Recursion, Stack, Queue, Strings, etc.)
- 📝 Key explanations written while learning from videos
- 💻 Practice problems solved in JavaScript
- ❓ Interview-style coding questions and their approaches

## 🎯 My Goal

To build a **solid foundation in DSA** that will help me in:

- Becoming a **better problem solver**
- Cracking **frontend developer interviews**
- Writing **optimized and clean code**

## 🔥 Progress

This repo will keep updating as I move forward step by step:

1. Arrays ✔️
2. Recursion ✔️
3. Stack & Queue 🚧
4. Strings 🚧
5. Hash Tables, Maps, Sets ⏭️
